1. When the admin gets an email upon new form submission,
he should get a nicely formatted table of the form. Right now, its unformatted.

2. Try to process sending emails in the background,
so that user gets through the page quickly without
having to wait for the email to be sent and then redirected.

3. In the function view_comedians, I am returning all the comedian objects.
In the Comedians page, all comedians will be displayed but only their picture, name and social media links will be shown.
Once you click on their picture, all details about them should show up on the same page only instead of redirecting.
You can use Cards for this!

4. BookMyShow does not have an API! so automating bms links is not an option.
We need to ask Mani if its the same link that bms has for every show or it keeps changing.
Depending on that, we could either hardcode the link to book tickets button, or give the admin
an option to put it for each event.
